# TUTORIAL-Good: AI That Protects Communities While Building Cyber Literacy

**Closing the cybersecurity skills gap, one incident at a time.**

This folder is the `usaii_global_ai` hackathon submission slice for **Project TUTORIAL** — an agentic
security platform that learns by teaching. The running system, APIs, and Docker stack live at
the repository root; this directory only contains narrative and demo guidance tailored for
judges here.

## Why this hackathon

Responsible AI guardrails, transparent investigation steps, and public-interest framing: defenders learn while organizations improve resilience.

## Quick links

- [SUBMISSION.md](./SUBMISSION.md) — full write-up for judges
- [demo_video_script.md](./demo_video_script.md) — 3–5 minute recording plan
- Repository docs: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/API.md`

## One-command demo (API)

```bash
cd /path/to/tutorial
docker compose up -d --build
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: tutorial-demo-key" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/system/health
```

Open the dashboard at `http://localhost` after compose (nginx → API).
